# SQL-Island-game
This is a walk through on the SQL Island game. After the survived plane crash, you will be stuck on SQL Island for the time being. By making progress in the game, you will find a way to escape from this island using SQL queries to work your way off the island. This is a fun and unique way to practice your SQL skills as you query the data to progress through the game (https://sql-island.informatik.uni-kl.de/)

Initially, when you open it, it will be in German. You can adjust this by clicking the burger menu on the top left of the screen and selecting "Change language" as shown below:
